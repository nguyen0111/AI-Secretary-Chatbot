# AI Secretary Bot Workflow

This repository contains the exported n8n workflow (`workflow.json`) for the **AI Secretary Bot**, a Telegram bot designed to help **track student conversations and registrations for LUT University**.  

The bot automatically listens to messages and voice notes from students, extracts structured information such as:  
- `Name`  
- `Arrival status at LUT`  
- `Tuition fee payment status`  
- `Housing application`  
- `Important notes`  

…and saves it directly into a Google Sheet for easy tracking. It also replies to the user with a confirmation message, so they know their information has been recorded.  
This bot is intended for administrative staff to track student registrations efficiently.
