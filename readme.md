# AI Secretary Bot Workflow

This repository contains the exported n8n workflow (workflow.json) for the AI Secretary Bot, a Telegram bot designed to help track student conversations and registrations for LUT University.

The bot automatically listens to messages and voice notes from students, extracts structured information such as:
- Name
- Arrival status at LUT
- Tuition fee payment status
- Housing application
- Important notes

‚Ä¶and saves it directly into a Google Sheet for easy tracking. It also replies to the user with a confirmation message, so they know their information has been recorded.
